Welcome to the new Blog of Puroto! What will this be all about and what can you expect here? Let's dive into this.

# The idea
Currently the community of this project is widely spread across places like Discord and Twitter. Which is fine, we are a project of variety after all. The problem we came across though was to do announcements and share informations about the Project and the community to you all while being able to actually give deep insight into the project. To solve this problem, we came to the idea to create this blog. But we won't stop here - we want this blog to be the central point of informations, announcements and the community of Puroto.

# Just announcements?
At the time of preparing the blog, we already have great ideas for keeping you all busy. We are planing on doing a bi-weekly post series about the internal development of Puroto as the software and Puroto as a community. At the same time, we want to create additional posts about various topics. Currently we ar preparing a QnA series for example to answer your questions. The geeky part of our community will be served well too, as we are planing on creating indepth overviews and explanations, maybe even some tutorials on Puroto's tech stack and the services we have created for the project.

> Please note that Puroto's source code is [always available on GitHub](https://github.com/PurotoApp) [under the terms of GPLv3](https://github.com/PurotoApp/authfox/blob/main/LICENSE). You are a developer yourself? feel free to take a look and maybe even help us out!

# Bi-weekly Puroto news 
As stated before, we are planing on creating some sort of news series for the Project soon where we will be giving an overview on what happened at Puroto in the meantime and what our community has done. This will include an indepth overview on code changes, planing and things like that. Don't worry though when you aren't that into techy stuff, we have you covered! The news posts will also feature things that happened in the community as well. You are an artist? Go ahead and create art of something Puroto related. We would love to feature community artwork in every post as well. You are awesome! 

# Diversity at Puroto 
Puroto is a community of a wide variety of people from different countries all over the world. Even the staff team consists of people from Germany, France, USA and a lot of other countries. Having such a wide spread team allows us to offer this blog in multiple languages. We at Puroto think that everyone should feel at home at Puroto and we're trying our best to make it that way.

We are trying our best to upload new posts with their translations while we publish them, but since we don't have backup for some languages, we might have to add them afterwards sometime. Thank you for understanding!

> Your native language isn't available yet? Feel free to [apply as a translator for our blog](https://apply.puroto.net/)! One-time translations of existing posts are appreciated as well!

# Summary
We hope you all are excited of the coming content here and the future of Puroto. We will do our best to work as close as possible with you, our community and inform you about the project! Join us to make the furry community pawsome! 

### We hope you join us for the next post!
